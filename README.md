Kasa is a password manager that you can self-serve and access from virtually anywhere. Itâ€™s built as a responsive PWA to work specifically with [Vercel's KV storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv). However, feel free to fork and integrate other solutions for data storage.


## Getting started

To get started, create a KV storage on your Vercel project and make sure to add the environment variables to your project, which are listed in the `.env.example` file. `KV_KEY_NAME` is a unique environment variable that you need to set. This key stores the encrypted data. `STORAGE_TYPE` should be set to `vercel-kv`. It can also be set to `local` for local testing purposes. The rest of the environment variables comes from the KV storage itself.
